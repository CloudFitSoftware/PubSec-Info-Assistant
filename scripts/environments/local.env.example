# If the SharePoint connector is enabled, use the following settings for a list of sharepoint sites and folders you want to index. 
# This is a SINGLE QUOTED JSON Object Array containing each sharepoint site and the corresponding entry folder
# Example: '[
#    { "url": "https://yoursharepoint.com", "folder": "/Shared Documents/YourFolder"},
#    { "url": "https://yoursharepoint.com", "folder": "/Shared Documents/YourFolder2"}
#    ]'
